    "text": "I lead the Innovation and Development department at Espartina S.A., an Argentinian agricultural production company undergoing a deep transformation toward an AI First model. My purpose is to leverage technology, data, and artificial intelligence to create meaningful impact on decisions, processes, and people.\nWith a solid background in GIS, Python programming, Google Earth Engine, and PostGIS-backed database development, I design and implement innovation strategies that integrate disciplines such as geospatial data science, remote sensing, process automation, and AI-driven optimization. My focus is always on efficiency, scalability, and ensuring that solutions are truly adopted by the teams that use them.\nBefore stepping into my current role, I led the GIS division at Espartina, developing tools and automated workflows for managing and analyzing spatial and productive data. Prior to that, I worked as a Senior Data Analyst for Major Accounts at S4 Agtech, a Buenos Aires–based company specializing in parametric drought insurance for agriculture. In that position, I contributed to analytics workflows supporting vegetation-index-based triggers and collaborated with insurers like Munich Re and Mapfre across Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, combining satellite data with spatial risk modeling and parametric insurance analytics.\nBeyond agriculture and technology, I have explored the applications of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in fintech and ag-tech, and I maintain a strong creative side through music. I studied jazz trumpet for several years and performed as a soloist in a professional big band. I have also played the piano since the age of six, focusing on classical, romantic, and impressionist repertoire — an artistic journey that has deeply shaped my discipline, sensitivity, and creativity.\nI am an Agronomist (UBA) with postgraduate studies in Agribusiness, Data Science, and Blockchain, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Open Source GIS. I am passionate about continuous learning, sharing knowledge, building bridges between disciplines, and transforming complex ideas into practical, sustainable solutions."
